    <h3 id="day">The day I saw you for the first time</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>French class - that little dimly lit classroom. You walked in with your greenish-blue kurta, and I was <p>mesmerised</p>. Maybe I have the details a little wrong - but I remember you sitting down while the teacher asked you where someone else was; and for the next few days - I couldn't help but steal little glances of you when you were focused on something else.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>And maybe things were quiet for a few months after that - we never really talked. I'll be a little honest here - Trupti kinda hid your pouch that dayy just so I could have an excuse to talk to you. And ever since that day, every conversation made me fall even harder. I was awkward at the beginning, and I still am - but who wouldn't be when faced with eyes that could level mounbtains? Maybe that's a little dramatic - but it sounds nice, doesn't it üòù</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>You're sweet, kind, <p>gorgeous</p> - and most importantly - <p>you love dinosaurs</p>. I can't think of anything more perfect even if I tried. Our little hi's in the corridor always make my day better - I miss it when I don't see it, and it's so cute how you look for me sometimes. I can't tell you how <p>excited</p> I am to go to that garbha with you or go to that photobooth on dfest üòù</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>I guess what I'm trying to say is - I really like you and I'd really like to be together. This page might be a bit too much, or even cringe - but it's from the bottom of my heart. </h3>
    <br> 
    <h3><p>Tes yeux sont incroyables, et tes beau rire est magnifique.</p></h3>
